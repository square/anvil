   * in this module. That often means you can skip KAPT and the stub generating task. In addition
   * Anvil generates Kotlin instead of Java code, which allows Gradle to skip the Java compilation
   * task. The result is faster builds.
   *
   * This feature can only be enabled in Gradle modules that don't compile any Dagger component.
   * Since Anvil only processes Kotlin code, you shouldn't enable it in modules with mixed Kotlin /
   * Java sources either.
   *
   * By default this feature is disabled.
