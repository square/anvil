# Change Log

## [2.4.0-M1] - 2022-03-03

### Added

- Rewrote many of the internals of Anvil and as a result Anvil is up to 41% faster.
- Automatically publish snapshot for the `main` branch.
- Documented Anvil's internal, see [here](https://github.com/square/anvil/blob/main/docs/INTERNALS.md).

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

- Removed support for Kotlin `1.5`.
- Removed deprecated APIs from the `AnvilExtension` in the gradle plugin.

### Fixed

- Generate code for `@ContributedSubcomponent`s when the trigger is created AFTER the contribution, see #478.
- Properly parse the `FqName` if the type reference is an inner class, see #479.

### Security


## [2.3.11] - 2022-01-28

### Changed

- Promote `@ContributesSubcomponent` to stable, see #474.
- Use Anvil version `2.3.11-1-6-10` if you use Kotlin `1.6.10`. Until Anvil hasn't adopted Kotlin `1.6` I'll publish additional versions that are required due to compiler API incompatibilities.
  - **Attention:** This is the last release to simultaneously support Kotlin 1.5 and 1.6. The next release will only support Kotlin 1.6.

### Added

- Support replacing `@ContributesSubcomponent` through a new `replaces` attribute, see #466.
- Support member injection for super types from different modules, see #438, #439 and #442.

### Fixed

- Avoid duplicate bindings when a `@ContributesSubcomponent` uses a factory and is used in multiple parent components, see #459.
- Fix rare duplicate bindings error for the same type with incremental compilation, see #460.
- Fix the import resolver for wildcard imports and inner classes, see #468.


## [2.3.10] - 2021-11-24

### Changed

- Add option to contribute class using `@MergeInterfaces` and `@MergeModules` to another scope with `@ContributesTo`.
- Add a workaround for a bug in the Kotlin 1.6.0 compiler, see [KT-49340](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-49340).
- Use Anvil version `2.3.10-1-6-0` if you want to test Kotlin `1.6.0`. Until Anvil hasn't adopted Kotlin `1.6` I'll publish additional versions that are required due to compiler API incompatibilities.

### Changed

- Add a workaround for AGP to sync generated sources with `syncGeneratedSources`, see #413.
- Ignore functions with defaults in assisted factories, see #415.
- Use Anvil version `2.3.9-1-6-0-RC2` if you want to test Kotlin `1.6.0-RC2`. Until Anvil hasn't adopted Kotlin `1.6` I'll publish additional versions that are required due to compiler API incompatibilities.
- Use Anvil version `2.3.9-1-6-0` if you want to test Kotlin `1.6.0`. Until Anvil hasn't adopted Kotlin `1.6` I'll publish additional versions that are required due to compiler API incompatibilities.

### Changed

- Add an option in the Anvil DSL `syncGeneratedSources` to sync generated sources in the IDE, see #412.

### Changed

- Upgraded Anvil to Kotlin `1.5.21`.
- Properly inject members when property setters are annotated, see #340.
- Properly inject members when using assisted injection, see #342.
- Don't generate a singleton factory (object), if the class with the inject constructor has any type parameter, see #348.

### Changed

- Remove an accidental required dependency on the Android Gradle Plugin, see #323.
- Ensure that excluded bindings and modules are only excluded for the specific component that merges a scope and not all components merging the same scope, see #321.

## [2.3.0] - 2021-06-02

### Changed

- Add option to extend Anvil with your own `CodeGenerator`, see [here](README.md#extending-anvil) and #265.
- Use Gradle Property APIs in the Anvil extension. This is a source-breaking change (but binary-compatible) for Kotlin and .kts consumers of the Anvil Gradle plugin, see #284.
- Upgrade Anvil to Kotlin `1.5.10`. The old legacy compiler backend is still supported and the IR backend not required yet.


## [2.2.3] - 2021-05-25

### Changed

- Support the JVM and Android targets for Kotlin Multiplatform projects, see #222.
- Add a generation only mode for Anvil in order to avoid performance penalties when still using KAPT in the same module, see #258.
- Respect qualifiers when checking whether there is a duplicate binding, see #270.

- Support using `@ContributesBinding` for objects and generate a `@Provides` rather than a `@Binds` function.
- Allow using Anvil to generate Dagger factories in modules using `@Subcomponent`, see #74.
- Reduce the size of the generated bytecode in certain scenarios, see #76.
- Stop adding the `@Generated` annotation. This leads to issues on Android where this annotation doesn't exist, see #75.

- Remove absolute paths in Kotlin compilation task inputs #65.
- Add new experimental feature to generate Dagger factories for faster build times.


## [2.0.0] - 2020-08-07

### Changed

- Change the `replaces` attribute from a single class to an array. This gives the API more flexibility and avoids redundant classes. E.g. one Dagger module with several binding and provider methods may wish to replace multiple other Dagger modules.
- Introduce the new `@ContributesBinding` annotation. This annotation allows you to contribute binding methods without actually writing a Dagger module.
    ```kotlin
    interface Authenticator
    
    @ContributesBinding(AppScope::class)
    class RealAuthenticator @Inject constructor() : Authenticator
    
    // The generated and automatically included Dagger module would look similar like this:
    @Module
    @ContributesTo(AppScope::class)
    abstract class AuthenticatorModule {
      @Binds abstract fun bindRealAuthenticator(authenticator: RealAuthenticator): Authenticator
    }
    ```
- Support nested classes for contributed Dagger modules and component interfaces if the outer class uses a different scope #45.


## [1.0.6] - 2020-07-29

## [1.0.5-1.4-M3] - 2020-07-24

### Changed

- Renamed the project from Hephaestus to Anvil #12. **IMPORTANT:** Anvil is not compatible with Hephaestus and you must upgrade the plugin in all of your libraries. The artifact coordinates changed, too.
- Same as `1.0.5`, only built with Kotlin 1.4-M3.
