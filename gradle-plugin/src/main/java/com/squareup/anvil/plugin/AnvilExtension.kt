   * Allows you to use Anvil to generate Factory classes that usually the Dagger annotation

   * The benefit of this feature is that you don't need to enable the Dagger annotation processor
   * in this module. That often means you can skip KAPT and the stub generating task. In addition,
   * Anvil generates Kotlin instead of Java code, which allows Gradle to skip the Java compilation
   * task. The result is faster builds.
   *
   * This feature can only be enabled in Gradle modules that don't compile any Dagger component.
   * Since Anvil only processes Kotlin code, you shouldn't enable it in modules with mixed Kotlin /
   * Java sources either.
   *
   * This feature is disabled by default.
